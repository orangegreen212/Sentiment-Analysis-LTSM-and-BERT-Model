        "#Project Overview: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews\n",
        "\n",
        "This script implements a complete pipeline to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie reviews. The project is broken down into the following key stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Data Loading and Preparation: The dataset is loaded, and a target variable (sentiment) is created based on the original movie ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Text Cleaning: A function is defined and applied to clean the raw text data by removing punctuation, and converting all text to lowercase.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Tokenization and Stop Word Removal: The cleaned text is broken down into individual words (tokens), and common but non-informative words (stop words) are removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Lemmatization: Words are reduced to their base or dictionary form (e.g., \"running\" and \"ran\" both become \"run\") to standardize the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. Vectorization: The processed text is converted into a numerical format that a neural network can understand. This involves creating a vocabulary and replacing each word with its corresponding integer index.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader Creation: The numerical data is wrapped into custom PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader classes for efficient batching and feeding into the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Model Creation (LSTM): A neural network architecture is built using PyTorch. It features a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer, which is well-suited for processing sequential data like text.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Model Training: A training loop is implemented to teach the model how to distinguish between positive and negative sentiment based on the prepared data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  9. Inference and Testing: The trained model's quality is evaluated, and a final function is created to analyze the sentiment of any new, arbitrary text string."

Moral judgements for four wealthy tech executives are only true or false, when viewed from their  perspective, which is mired in hyper capitalism. For them, morality is grounded in the ruthless pursuit of  individual wealth, allegedly to leverage technocratic human evolution (trans-humanism). \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one of them challenges this world view, during a rich pals getaway, things turn darkly comical.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see the rather understated critique of the modern obsession with an on line life this film presents. A place where truth is allegedly manufactured, not told.\\r\\nThe gleeful, almost childlike immaturity, wilful recklessness and narcissism, of those who have built it. Also on a certain level, the tech elites uselessness. One can't even boil an egg. So much for the value of social media, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell yes and frankly, \"no\". This film overplays its hand. It tries to promote the mainstream media as a source of truth, when in fact, people have turned to social media precisely \"because\" of mainstream journalism's unwillingness, to tell truth to power. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of its flaws, social media has given genuine investigative journalists and courageous whistle blowers, a platform to expose the malfeasance of corrupted power. Something this film, rather too conveniently, overlooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, this is not a bad film. As a mild, dark comedy, it very reasonably makes wholly valid points about social media and by extension, big tech's, shortcomings. Where it falls short, its its inability to tell the other side of the story. In vogue labels, like \"misinformation\", so popular with glib politicians and the less than transparent mainstream media, could as easily be applied to them, as they could, the high tech, on line world and those who built it.   \n",

It felt derivatively unoriginal and fairly predictable, with unnatural dialogue not helping. I could ignore that if the kills were cool, but none of which really came across as all that meaningful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prom setting is an issue, it's one that feels so overdone in movies that any new release needs to do something extra unique to stand out - and I don't believe this one does anything close to that. It is at least short in run time and those onscreen don't produce anything all that bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia Fowler's Lori is admittedly the only character I found to be minimally interesting, though Fina Strazza does put in a decent performance too as Tiffany. She is overly cartooney, though the same can be said for Chris Klein and others to be honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarrin Baker's character has a dumb catchphrase, though I admit I found it to be passably amusing. I will also give credit for the ending, I didn't love it but, to be fair, I didn't predict one part of the reveal - so kudos for that. It sadly isn't enough to save what proceeds, mind you.   \n",

Is it predictable? Absolutely. Formulaic? No doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it’s undeniably fun, visually engaging, and driven by a charismatic cast and a director who knows exactly what he’s doing. Guy Ritchie brings his trademark energy without betraying the genre’s core identity, and James Vanderbilt delivers a solid, compelling script.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a shame the film didn’t get the theater release it deserved – like the ancient sites it explores, it should have been experienced in all its grandeur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B   \n",

I can’t really dispute that. But since I was walking in with my eyes wide open, I enjoyed it for what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere isn’t enough exploration or exposition that gives us any idea what the characters are really about and we’re left to pee together through throwaway lines and a bunch of inferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several characters that are involved that you never find out what their backstory is, why they’re doing what they’re doing, or what the end goal is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is one we’ve all heard before, and the neat little tricks and puzzles. It takes to find the end goal is clever and brings back memories of the da Vinci code and other similar stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will be one of those movies that’s on and families can enjoy for quite some time, but it won’t win any awards. Still it entertained me for the two hours it was on and at this point, that’s all I’m looking for in movies.   \n",

There were aspects about it from the perspective of an origin story that were interesting but something about the pacing and acting just felt… off. I can't quite put my finger on it but the first word that comes to mind is \"campy\". Kind of like I was watching one of the last three Star Wars movies. The dialog and overall tone just weren't serious enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trailer for [X-Men: Days of Future Past](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/127585-x-men-days-of-future-past) looks better and Bryan Singer is back at the helm. The best X-Men movies are without a doubt 1 & 2 so here's hoping he can steer this back a bit.   \n",
              "2893  On IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of \"normal\" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that…), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the \"old\" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy… \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything.

I felt entertained throughout with nothing bothering me whatsoever, with the score and the cast particularly standing out. I will say it starts stronger than it ends, but that's not to say it isn't all enjoyable because it certainly is.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames McAvoy is very good as Charles Xavier, while Michael Fassbender is excellent as Erik Lehnsherr. Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence and Kevin Bacon were three others who I liked watching too. Back to the score, it's tremendous - some parts reminded me of the outstanding theme of television's <em>'The Crown'</em>.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was feeling the decline across the preceding four releases, but thankfully this regains the series' footing and then some. Intrigued to see where it goes from here. Onwards to <em>'The Wolverine'</em>*! *watching in release order\\r\\n\\r\\n/copied directly from my Letterboxd review\\   \n",

James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger \"Xavier\" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of \"Erik\". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of \"Shaw\" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and \"Erik\" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's \"Raven\" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky \"Hank\" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of \"Magneto\" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the \"X-Men\". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen.   \n",

First Class tells the origin story of Xavier, Magneto, and the X-Men with a 1960s setting and inexperienced young heroes. These raw and unrefined portrayals of Magneto and Xavier shined the characters in a fascinating new light. The story was engaging and fresh. It felt so new and unique - unlike anything ever seen before with this franchise. All these little-known characters raised the stakes since so many weren’t a part of the original movies leaving their fates unknown and futures unsecured. The 60s style added a cool new aesthetic to the franchise and seeing the beginning of the friendship between Xavier and Magneto with moments of laughter and fun gave the franchise the reboot it needed.   \n",

Moral judgements for four wealthy tech executives are only true or false, when viewed from their  perspective, which is mired in hyper capitalism. For them, morality is grounded in the ruthless pursuit of  individual wealth, allegedly to leverage technocratic human evolution (trans-humanism). \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one of them challenges this world view, during a rich pals getaway, things turn darkly comical.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see the rather understated critique of the modern obsession with an on line life this film presents. A place where truth is allegedly manufactured, not told.\\r\\nThe gleeful, almost childlike immaturity, wilful recklessness and narcissism, of those who have built it. Also on a certain level, the tech elites uselessness. One can't even boil an egg. So much for the value of social media, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell yes and frankly, \"no\". This film overplays its hand. It tries to promote the mainstream media as a source of truth, when in fact, people have turned to social media precisely \"because\" of mainstream journalism's unwillingness, to tell truth to power. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of its flaws, social media has given genuine investigative journalists and courageous whistle blowers, a platform to expose the malfeasance of corrupted power. Something this film, rather too conveniently, overlooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, this is not a bad film. As a mild, dark comedy, it very reasonably makes wholly valid points about social media and by extension, big tech's, shortcomings. Where it falls short, its its inability to tell the other side of the story. In vogue labels, like \"misinformation\", so popular with glib politicians and the less than transparent mainstream media, could as easily be applied to them, as they could, the high tech, on line world and those who built it.</td>\n",

I could ignore that if the kills were cool, but none of which really came across as all that meaningful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prom setting is an issue, it's one that feels so overdone in movies that any new release needs to do something extra unique to stand out - and I don't believe this one does anything close to that. It is at least short in run time and those onscreen don't produce anything all that bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia Fowler's Lori is admittedly the only character I found to be minimally interesting, though Fina Strazza does put in a decent performance too as Tiffany. She is overly cartooney, though the same can be said for Chris Klein and others to be honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarrin Baker's character has a dumb catchphrase, though I admit I found it to be passably amusing. I will also give credit for the ending, I didn't love it but, to be fair, I didn't predict one part of the reveal - so kudos for that. It sadly isn't enough to save what proceeds, mind you.</td>\n",

Guy Ritchie brings his trademark energy without betraying the genre’s core identity, and James Vanderbilt delivers a solid, compelling script.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a shame the film didn’t get the theater release it deserved – like the ancient sites it explores, it should have been experienced in all its grandeur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B</td>\n",

But since I was walking in with my eyes wide open, I enjoyed it for what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere isn’t enough exploration or exposition that gives us any idea what the characters are really about and we’re left to pee together through throwaway lines and a bunch of inferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several characters that are involved that you never find out what their backstory is, why they’re doing what they’re doing, or what the end goal is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is one we’ve all heard before, and the neat little tricks and puzzles. It takes to find the end goal is clever and brings back memories of the da Vinci code and other similar stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will be one of those movies that’s on and families can enjoy for quite some time, but it won’t win any awards. Still it entertained me for the two hours it was on and at this point, that’s all I’m looking for in movies.</td>\n",

              "      <td>On IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of \"normal\" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that…), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the \"old\" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy… \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything.

James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger \"Xavier\" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of \"Erik\". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of \"Shaw\" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and \"Erik\" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's \"Raven\" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky \"Hank\" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of \"Magneto\" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the \"X-Men\". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen.</td>\n",

First Class tells the origin story of Xavier, Magneto, and the X-Men with a 1960s setting and inexperienced young heroes. These raw and unrefined portrayals of Magneto and Xavier shined the characters in a fascinating new light. The story was engaging and fresh. It felt so new and unique - unlike anything ever seen before with this franchise. All these little-known characters raised the stakes since so many weren’t a part of the original movies leaving their fates unknown and futures unsecured. The 60s style added a cool new aesthetic to the franchise and seeing the beginning of the friendship between Xavier and Magneto with moments of laughter and fun gave the franchise the reboot it needed.</td>\n",

It was totally new and held plenty of action so it was worth watching once. Twice? Probably not. The second was much the same as the first and by the fourth you are as bored as it can get. Not sure what's wrong with Keanu, but having fun making a movie and actually making something worth watching are two very different things.\\r\\nThe guy should keep his james bond ninja training fantasies to himself and maybe think about producing and acting in something that doesn't make him look like a child. This movie was pure garbage. What a waste of time and money. Let's just hope he didn't get the shot.\",\n          \"I have to say that I did not have great hopes for this movie. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. As can be expected from a Marvel super hero movie it is not the most intelligent plot around but instead rather heavy on special effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving said that the plot is not bad given the context. I have never read any of the Ant-Man comics so I had no idea what to expect. The little expectation I had was of some guy turning into some ant like creature smashing things left right and center. So it was somewhat of a surprise to me when I found out that the guy was actually shrinking himself to ant size. Actually I went a bit \\u201cwhat the f\\u2026\\u201d when I first realized this and felt that this was going to be boring.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in the end, I felt it worked out quite well. If it would have just been about some guy shrinking himself then it would indeed have been somewhat boring but the added coolness of this guy being able to command armies of bad-ass ants really helped stave of the boredom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I wrote above it is a Marvel super hero movie so it is heavy on special effects and, personally, I felt they where quite okay. There is of course quite a bit of action in the movie as well as a bit of humour. I quite liked the parts where the Ant-Man and his nemesis slugged it out in a children\\u2019s room and a giant size Thomas the Tank Engine was thrown through the roof and into the garden. Maybe I liked it because Thomas the Tank Engine is a TV show that my kids liked to watch when they were smaller. There where of course a few of the usual Hollywood silly, brain-dead stunts like the tank scene. It could have been so cool but it was really ruined by the total lack of intelligence in the stunt following the cool revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really liked Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym as well as Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne. I was not too impressed by Paul Rudd but on the while I guess he was not too bad. It is a bit of a shame though that when Hollywood feels they need to throw in a bit of family drama they always have to throw in a divorce. It is rather depressing for us that have lived through such a tragedy after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBottom line, this was a surprisingly enjoyable movie. Far better than quite a few of the super hero movies that Marvel/Hollywood have produced like for instance the abysmal Spiderman movies although that is of course a personal opinion.\",\n          \"Sam Raimi's Spider-Man captures the spirit of the comic book hero and it's still one of my all time favourite superhero movies. It lays out the perfect blueprint for a superhero origin story that I love revisiting every year or so. I've always been able to relate to Peter Parker growing up. Tobey Maguire and Co. delivered a great interpretation of the characters in a way that still can not be matched.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2897,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/67bc856655e3994bbd46b6f9\",\n          \"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58a720ecc3a368672e00abda\",\n          \"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/616afe9207a808004482bd65\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_created_at\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2897,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2025-02-24T14:42:46.422Z\",\n          \"2017-02-17T16:12:28.821Z\",\n          \"2021-10-16T16:32:18.509Z\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"author_rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2.177910757121824,\n        \"min\": 0.5,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6.0,\n          5.0,\n          3.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "0  \"Moutainhead\"aspires to be more, than it reasonably achieves. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn one sense its an exercise in moral relativism. Moral judgements for four wealthy tech executives are only true or false, when viewed from their  perspective, which is mired in hyper capitalism. For them, morality is grounded in the ruthless pursuit of  individual wealth, allegedly to leverage technocratic human evolution (trans-humanism). \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one of them challenges this world view, during a rich pals getaway, things turn darkly comical.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see the rather understated critique of the modern obsession with an on line life this film presents. A place where truth is allegedly manufactured, not told.\\r\\nThe gleeful, almost childlike immaturity, wilful recklessness and narcissism, of those who have built it. Also on a certain level, the tech elites uselessness. One can't even boil an egg. So much for the value of social media, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell yes and frankly, \"no\". This film overplays its hand. It tries to promote the mainstream media as a source of truth, when in fact, people have turned to social media precisely \"because\" of mainstream journalism's unwillingness, to tell truth to power. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of its flaws, social media has given genuine investigative journalists and courageous whistle blowers, a platform to expose the malfeasance of corrupted power. Something this film, rather too conveniently, overlooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, this is not a bad film. As a mild, dark comedy, it very reasonably makes wholly valid points about social media and by extension, big tech's, shortcomings. Where it falls short, its its inability to tell the other side of the story. In vogue labels, like \"misinformation\", so popular with glib politicians and the less than transparent mainstream media, could as easily be applied to them, as they could, the high tech, on line world and those who built it.   \n",

It felt derivatively unoriginal and fairly predictable, with unnatural dialogue not helping. I could ignore that if the kills were cool, but none of which really came across as all that meaningful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prom setting is an issue, it's one that feels so overdone in movies that any new release needs to do something extra unique to stand out - and I don't believe this one does anything close to that. It is at least short in run time and those onscreen don't produce anything all that bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia Fowler's Lori is admittedly the only character I found to be minimally interesting, though Fina Strazza does put in a decent performance too as Tiffany. She is overly cartooney, though the same can be said for Chris Klein and others to be honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarrin Baker's character has a dumb catchphrase, though I admit I found it to be passably amusing. I will also give credit for the ending, I didn't love it but, to be fair, I didn't predict one part of the reveal - so kudos for that. It sadly isn't enough to save what proceeds, mind you.   \n",

I can’t really dispute that. But since I was walking in with my eyes wide open, I enjoyed it for what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere isn’t enough exploration or exposition that gives us any idea what the characters are really about and we’re left to pee together through throwaway lines and a bunch of inferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several characters that are involved that you never find out what their backstory is, why they’re doing what they’re doing, or what the end goal is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is one we’ve all heard before, and the neat little tricks and puzzles. It takes to find the end goal is clever and brings back memories of the da Vinci code and other similar stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will be one of those movies that’s on and families can enjoy for quite some time, but it won’t win any awards.

Moral judgements for four wealthy tech executives are only true or false, when viewed from their  perspective, which is mired in hyper capitalism. For them, morality is grounded in the ruthless pursuit of  individual wealth, allegedly to leverage technocratic human evolution (trans-humanism). \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one of them challenges this world view, during a rich pals getaway, things turn darkly comical.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see the rather understated critique of the modern obsession with an on line life this film presents. A place where truth is allegedly manufactured, not told.\\r\\nThe gleeful, almost childlike immaturity, wilful recklessness and narcissism, of those who have built it. Also on a certain level, the tech elites uselessness. One can't even boil an egg. So much for the value of social media, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell yes and frankly, \"no\". This film overplays its hand. It tries to promote the mainstream media as a source of truth, when in fact, people have turned to social media precisely \"because\" of mainstream journalism's unwillingness, to tell truth to power. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of its flaws, social media has given genuine investigative journalists and courageous whistle blowers, a platform to expose the malfeasance of corrupted power. Something this film, rather too conveniently, overlooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, this is not a bad film. As a mild, dark comedy, it very reasonably makes wholly valid points about social media and by extension, big tech's, shortcomings. Where it falls short, its its inability to tell the other side of the story. In vogue labels, like \"misinformation\", so popular with glib politicians and the less than transparent mainstream media, could as easily be applied to them, as they could, the high tech, on line world and those who built it.   \n",

It felt derivatively unoriginal and fairly predictable, with unnatural dialogue not helping. I could ignore that if the kills were cool, but none of which really came across as all that meaningful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prom setting is an issue, it's one that feels so overdone in movies that any new release needs to do something extra unique to stand out - and I don't believe this one does anything close to that. It is at least short in run time and those onscreen don't produce anything all that bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia Fowler's Lori is admittedly the only character I found to be minimally interesting, though Fina Strazza does put in a decent performance too as Tiffany. She is overly cartooney, though the same can be said for Chris Klein and others to be honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarrin Baker's character has a dumb catchphrase, though I admit I found it to be passably amusing. I will also give credit for the ending, I didn't love it but, to be fair, I didn't predict one part of the reveal - so kudos for that. It sadly isn't enough to save what proceeds, mind you.   \n",

Is it predictable? Absolutely. Formulaic? No doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it’s undeniably fun, visually engaging, and driven by a charismatic cast and a director who knows exactly what he’s doing. Guy Ritchie brings his trademark energy without betraying the genre’s core identity, and James Vanderbilt delivers a solid, compelling script.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a shame the film didn’t get the theater release it deserved – like the ancient sites it explores, it should have been experienced in all its grandeur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B   \n",

I can’t really dispute that. But since I was walking in with my eyes wide open, I enjoyed it for what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere isn’t enough exploration or exposition that gives us any idea what the characters are really about and we’re left to pee together through throwaway lines and a bunch of inferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several characters that are involved that you never find out what their backstory is, why they’re doing what they’re doing, or what the end goal is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is one we’ve all heard before, and the neat little tricks and puzzles. It takes to find the end goal is clever and brings back memories of the da Vinci code and other similar stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will be one of those movies that’s on and families can enjoy for quite some time, but it won’t win any awards. Still it entertained me for the two hours it was on and at this point, that’s all I’m looking for in movies.   \n",

There were aspects about it from the perspective of an origin story that were interesting but something about the pacing and acting just felt… off. I can't quite put my finger on it but the first word that comes to mind is \"campy\". Kind of like I was watching one of the last three Star Wars movies. The dialog and overall tone just weren't serious enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trailer for [X-Men: Days of Future Past](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/127585-x-men-days-of-future-past) looks better and Bryan Singer is back at the helm. The best X-Men movies are without a doubt 1 & 2 so here's hoping he can steer this back a bit.   \n",
              "2893  On IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of \"normal\" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that…), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the \"old\" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy… \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything.

I felt entertained throughout with nothing bothering me whatsoever, with the score and the cast particularly standing out. I will say it starts stronger than it ends, but that's not to say it isn't all enjoyable because it certainly is.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames McAvoy is very good as Charles Xavier, while Michael Fassbender is excellent as Erik Lehnsherr. Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence and Kevin Bacon were three others who I liked watching too. Back to the score, it's tremendous - some parts reminded me of the outstanding theme of television's <em>'The Crown'</em>.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was feeling the decline across the preceding four releases, but thankfully this regains the series' footing and then some. Intrigued to see where it goes from here. Onwards to <em>'The Wolverine'</em>*! *watching in release order\\r\\n\\r\\n/copied directly from my Letterboxd review\\   \n",

James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger \"Xavier\" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of \"Erik\". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of \"Shaw\" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and \"Erik\" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's \"Raven\" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky \"Hank\" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of \"Magneto\" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the \"X-Men\". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen.   \n",

First Class tells the origin story of Xavier, Magneto, and the X-Men with a 1960s setting and inexperienced young heroes. These raw and unrefined portrayals of Magneto and Xavier shined the characters in a fascinating new light. The story was engaging and fresh. It felt so new and unique - unlike anything ever seen before with this franchise. All these little-known characters raised the stakes since so many weren’t a part of the original movies leaving their fates unknown and futures unsecured. The 60s style added a cool new aesthetic to the franchise and seeing the beginning of the friendship between Xavier and Magneto with moments of laughter and fun gave the franchise the reboot it needed.   \n",

For them, morality is grounded in the ruthless pursuit of  individual wealth, allegedly to leverage technocratic human evolution (trans-humanism). \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one of them challenges this world view, during a rich pals getaway, things turn darkly comical.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see the rather understated critique of the modern obsession with an on line life this film presents. A place where truth is allegedly manufactured, not told.\\r\\nThe gleeful, almost childlike immaturity, wilful recklessness and narcissism, of those who have built it. Also on a certain level, the tech elites uselessness. One can't even boil an egg. So much for the value of social media, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell yes and frankly, \"no\". This film overplays its hand. It tries to promote the mainstream media as a source of truth, when in fact, people have turned to social media precisely \"because\" of mainstream journalism's unwillingness, to tell truth to power. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of its flaws, social media has given genuine investigative journalists and courageous whistle blowers, a platform to expose the malfeasance of corrupted power. Something this film, rather too conveniently, overlooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, this is not a bad film. As a mild, dark comedy, it very reasonably makes wholly valid points about social media and by extension, big tech's, shortcomings. Where it falls short, its its inability to tell the other side of the story. In vogue labels, like \"misinformation\", so popular with glib politicians and the less than transparent mainstream media, could as easily be applied to them, as they could, the high tech, on line world and those who built it.</td>\n",

              "      <td>On IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of \"normal\" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that…), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the \"old\" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy… \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything.

              "      <td>If it's not sacrilegious for a Brit, I found this outing for the \"X-Men\" to be far better without the presence of the two elderly thespians who usually underpin these adventures. James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger \"Xavier\" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of \"Erik\". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of \"Shaw\" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and \"Erik\" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's \"Raven\" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky \"Hank\" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of \"Magneto\" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the \"X-Men\". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen.</td>\n",

First Class tells the origin story of Xavier, Magneto, and the X-Men with a 1960s setting and inexperienced young heroes. These raw and unrefined portrayals of Magneto and Xavier shined the characters in a fascinating new light. The story was engaging and fresh. It felt so new and unique - unlike anything ever seen before with this franchise. All these little-known characters raised the stakes since so many weren’t a part of the original movies leaving their fates unknown and futures unsecured. The 60s style added a cool new aesthetic to the franchise and seeing the beginning of the friendship between Xavier and Magneto with moments of laughter and fun gave the franchise the reboot it needed.</td>\n",

It was totally new and held plenty of action so it was worth watching once. Twice? Probably not. The second was much the same as the first and by the fourth you are as bored as it can get. Not sure what's wrong with Keanu, but having fun making a movie and actually making something worth watching are two very different things.\\r\\nThe guy should keep his james bond ninja training fantasies to himself and maybe think about producing and acting in something that doesn't make him look like a child. This movie was pure garbage. What a waste of time and money. Let's just hope he didn't get the shot.\",\n          \"I have to say that I did not have great hopes for this movie. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. As can be expected from a Marvel super hero movie it is not the most intelligent plot around but instead rather heavy on special effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving said that the plot is not bad given the context. I have never read any of the Ant-Man comics so I had no idea what to expect. The little expectation I had was of some guy turning into some ant like creature smashing things left right and center. So it was somewhat of a surprise to me when I found out that the guy was actually shrinking himself to ant size. Actually I went a bit \\u201cwhat the f\\u2026\\u201d when I first realized this and felt that this was going to be boring.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in the end, I felt it worked out quite well. If it would have just been about some guy shrinking himself then it would indeed have been somewhat boring but the added coolness of this guy being able to command armies of bad-ass ants really helped stave of the boredom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I wrote above it is a Marvel super hero movie so it is heavy on special effects and, personally, I felt they where quite okay. There is of course quite a bit of action in the movie as well as a bit of humour. I quite liked the parts where the Ant-Man and his nemesis slugged it out in a children\\u2019s room and a giant size Thomas the Tank Engine was thrown through the roof and into the garden. Maybe I liked it because Thomas the Tank Engine is a TV show that my kids liked to watch when they were smaller. There where of course a few of the usual Hollywood silly, brain-dead stunts like the tank scene. It could have been so cool but it was really ruined by the total lack of intelligence in the stunt following the cool revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really liked Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym as well as Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne. I was not too impressed by Paul Rudd but on the while I guess he was not too bad. It is a bit of a shame though that when Hollywood feels they need to throw in a bit of family drama they always have to throw in a divorce. It is rather depressing for us that have lived through such a tragedy after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBottom line, this was a surprisingly enjoyable movie. Far better than quite a few of the super hero movies that Marvel/Hollywood have produced like for instance the abysmal Spiderman movies although that is of course a personal opinion.\",\n          \"Sam Raimi's Spider-Man captures the spirit of the comic book hero and it's still one of my all time favourite superhero movies. It lays out the perfect blueprint for a superhero origin story that I love revisiting every year or so. I've always been able to relate to Peter Parker growing up. Tobey Maguire and Co. delivered a great interpretation of the characters in a way that still can not be matched.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Moral judgements for four wealthy tech executives are only true or false, when viewed from their  perspective, which is mired in hyper capitalism. For them, morality is grounded in the ruthless pursuit of  individual wealth, allegedly to leverage technocratic human evolution (trans-humanism). \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one of them challenges this world view, during a rich pals getaway, things turn darkly comical.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see the rather understated critique of the modern obsession with an on line life this film presents. A place where truth is allegedly manufactured, not told.\\r\\nThe gleeful, almost childlike immaturity, wilful recklessness and narcissism, of those who have built it. Also on a certain level, the tech elites uselessness. One can't even boil an egg. So much for the value of social media, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell yes and frankly, \"no\". This film overplays its hand. It tries to promote the mainstream media as a source of truth, when in fact, people have turned to social media precisely \"because\" of mainstream journalism's unwillingness, to tell truth to power. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of its flaws, social media has given genuine investigative journalists and courageous whistle blowers, a platform to expose the malfeasance of corrupted power. Something this film, rather too conveniently, overlooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, this is not a bad film. As a mild, dark comedy, it very reasonably makes wholly valid points about social media and by extension, big tech's, shortcomings. Where it falls short, its its inability to tell the other side of the story. In vogue labels, like \"misinformation\", so popular with glib politicians and the less than transparent mainstream media, could as easily be applied to them, as they could, the high tech, on line world and those who built it.   \n",

It felt derivatively unoriginal and fairly predictable, with unnatural dialogue not helping. I could ignore that if the kills were cool, but none of which really came across as all that meaningful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prom setting is an issue, it's one that feels so overdone in movies that any new release needs to do something extra unique to stand out - and I don't believe this one does anything close to that. It is at least short in run time and those onscreen don't produce anything all that bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia Fowler's Lori is admittedly the only character I found to be minimally interesting, though Fina Strazza does put in a decent performance too as Tiffany. She is overly cartooney, though the same can be said for Chris Klein and others to be honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarrin Baker's character has a dumb catchphrase, though I admit I found it to be passably amusing. I will also give credit for the ending, I didn't love it but, to be fair, I didn't predict one part of the reveal - so kudos for that. It sadly isn't enough to save what proceeds, mind you.   \n",

Is it predictable? Absolutely. Formulaic? No doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it’s undeniably fun, visually engaging, and driven by a charismatic cast and a director who knows exactly what he’s doing. Guy Ritchie brings his trademark energy without betraying the genre’s core identity, and James Vanderbilt delivers a solid, compelling script.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a shame the film didn’t get the theater release it deserved – like the ancient sites it explores, it should have been experienced in all its grandeur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B   \n",

I can’t really dispute that. But since I was walking in with my eyes wide open, I enjoyed it for what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere isn’t enough exploration or exposition that gives us any idea what the characters are really about and we’re left to pee together through throwaway lines and a bunch of inferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several characters that are involved that you never find out what their backstory is, why they’re doing what they’re doing, or what the end goal is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is one we’ve all heard before, and the neat little tricks and puzzles. It takes to find the end goal is clever and brings back memories of the da Vinci code and other similar stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will be one of those movies that’s on and families can enjoy for quite some time, but it won’t win any awards. Still it entertained me for the two hours it was on and at this point, that’s all I’m looking for in movies.   \n",

There were aspects about it from the perspective of an origin story that were interesting but something about the pacing and acting just felt… off. I can't quite put my finger on it but the first word that comes to mind is \"campy\". Kind of like I was watching one of the last three Star Wars movies. The dialog and overall tone just weren't serious enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trailer for [X-Men: Days of Future Past](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/127585-x-men-days-of-future-past) looks better and Bryan Singer is back at the helm. The best X-Men movies are without a doubt 1 & 2 so here's hoping he can steer this back a bit.   \n",
              "2893  On IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of \"normal\" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that…), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the \"old\" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy… \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything.

I felt entertained throughout with nothing bothering me whatsoever, with the score and the cast particularly standing out. I will say it starts stronger than it ends, but that's not to say it isn't all enjoyable because it certainly is.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames McAvoy is very good as Charles Xavier, while Michael Fassbender is excellent as Erik Lehnsherr. Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence and Kevin Bacon were three others who I liked watching too. Back to the score, it's tremendous - some parts reminded me of the outstanding theme of television's <em>'The Crown'</em>.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was feeling the decline across the preceding four releases, but thankfully this regains the series' footing and then some. Intrigued to see where it goes from here. Onwards to <em>'The Wolverine'</em>*! *watching in release order\\r\\n\\r\\n/copied directly from my Letterboxd review\\   \n",

James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger \"Xavier\" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of \"Erik\". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of \"Shaw\" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and \"Erik\" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's \"Raven\" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky \"Hank\" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of \"Magneto\" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the \"X-Men\". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen.   \n",

First Class tells the origin story of Xavier, Magneto, and the X-Men with a 1960s setting and inexperienced young heroes. These raw and unrefined portrayals of Magneto and Xavier shined the characters in a fascinating new light. The story was engaging and fresh. It felt so new and unique - unlike anything ever seen before with this franchise. All these little-known characters raised the stakes since so many weren’t a part of the original movies leaving their fates unknown and futures unsecured. The 60s style added a cool new aesthetic to the franchise and seeing the beginning of the friendship between Xavier and Magneto with moments of laughter and fun gave the franchise the reboot it needed.   \n",

Moral judgements for four wealthy tech executives are only true or false, when viewed from their  perspective, which is mired in hyper capitalism. For them, morality is grounded in the ruthless pursuit of  individual wealth, allegedly to leverage technocratic human evolution (trans-humanism). \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one of them challenges this world view, during a rich pals getaway, things turn darkly comical.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see the rather understated critique of the modern obsession with an on line life this film presents. A place where truth is allegedly manufactured, not told.\\r\\nThe gleeful, almost childlike immaturity, wilful recklessness and narcissism, of those who have built it. Also on a certain level, the tech elites uselessness. One can't even boil an egg. So much for the value of social media, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell yes and frankly, \"no\". This film overplays its hand. It tries to promote the mainstream media as a source of truth, when in fact, people have turned to social media precisely \"because\" of mainstream journalism's unwillingness, to tell truth to power. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of its flaws, social media has given genuine investigative journalists and courageous whistle blowers, a platform to expose the malfeasance of corrupted power. Something this film, rather too conveniently, overlooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, this is not a bad film. As a mild, dark comedy, it very reasonably makes wholly valid points about social media and by extension, big tech's, shortcomings. Where it falls short, its its inability to tell the other side of the story. In vogue labels, like \"misinformation\", so popular with glib politicians and the less than transparent mainstream media, could as easily be applied to them, as they could, the high tech, on line world and those who built it.</td>\n",

I could ignore that if the kills were cool, but none of which really came across as all that meaningful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prom setting is an issue, it's one that feels so overdone in movies that any new release needs to do something extra unique to stand out - and I don't believe this one does anything close to that. It is at least short in run time and those onscreen don't produce anything all that bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia Fowler's Lori is admittedly the only character I found to be minimally interesting, though Fina Strazza does put in a decent performance too as Tiffany. She is overly cartooney, though the same can be said for Chris Klein and others to be honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarrin Baker's character has a dumb catchphrase, though I admit I found it to be passably amusing. I will also give credit for the ending, I didn't love it but, to be fair, I didn't predict one part of the reveal - so kudos for that. It sadly isn't enough to save what proceeds, mind you.</td>\n",

Guy Ritchie brings his trademark energy without betraying the genre’s core identity, and James Vanderbilt delivers a solid, compelling script.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a shame the film didn’t get the theater release it deserved – like the ancient sites it explores, it should have been experienced in all its grandeur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B</td>\n",

But since I was walking in with my eyes wide open, I enjoyed it for what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere isn’t enough exploration or exposition that gives us any idea what the characters are really about and we’re left to pee together through throwaway lines and a bunch of inferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several characters that are involved that you never find out what their backstory is, why they’re doing what they’re doing, or what the end goal is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is one we’ve all heard before, and the neat little tricks and puzzles. It takes to find the end goal is clever and brings back memories of the da Vinci code and other similar stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will be one of those movies that’s on and families can enjoy for quite some time, but it won’t win any awards. Still it entertained me for the two hours it was on and at this point, that’s all I’m looking for in movies.</td>\n",

              "      <td>On IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of \"normal\" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that…), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the \"old\" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy… \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything.

James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger \"Xavier\" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of \"Erik\". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of \"Shaw\" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and \"Erik\" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's \"Raven\" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky \"Hank\" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of \"Magneto\" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the \"X-Men\". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen.</td>\n",

First Class tells the origin story of Xavier, Magneto, and the X-Men with a 1960s setting and inexperienced young heroes. These raw and unrefined portrayals of Magneto and Xavier shined the characters in a fascinating new light. The story was engaging and fresh. It felt so new and unique - unlike anything ever seen before with this franchise. All these little-known characters raised the stakes since so many weren’t a part of the original movies leaving their fates unknown and futures unsecured. The 60s style added a cool new aesthetic to the franchise and seeing the beginning of the friendship between Xavier and Magneto with moments of laughter and fun gave the franchise the reboot it needed.</td>\n",

It was totally new and held plenty of action so it was worth watching once. Twice? Probably not. The second was much the same as the first and by the fourth you are as bored as it can get. Not sure what's wrong with Keanu, but having fun making a movie and actually making something worth watching are two very different things.\\r\\nThe guy should keep his james bond ninja training fantasies to himself and maybe think about producing and acting in something that doesn't make him look like a child. This movie was pure garbage. What a waste of time and money. Let's just hope he didn't get the shot.\",\n          \"I have to say that I did not have great hopes for this movie. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. As can be expected from a Marvel super hero movie it is not the most intelligent plot around but instead rather heavy on special effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving said that the plot is not bad given the context. I have never read any of the Ant-Man comics so I had no idea what to expect. The little expectation I had was of some guy turning into some ant like creature smashing things left right and center. So it was somewhat of a surprise to me when I found out that the guy was actually shrinking himself to ant size. Actually I went a bit \\u201cwhat the f\\u2026\\u201d when I first realized this and felt that this was going to be boring.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in the end, I felt it worked out quite well. If it would have just been about some guy shrinking himself then it would indeed have been somewhat boring but the added coolness of this guy being able to command armies of bad-ass ants really helped stave of the boredom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I wrote above it is a Marvel super hero movie so it is heavy on special effects and, personally, I felt they where quite okay. There is of course quite a bit of action in the movie as well as a bit of humour. I quite liked the parts where the Ant-Man and his nemesis slugged it out in a children\\u2019s room and a giant size Thomas the Tank Engine was thrown through the roof and into the garden. Maybe I liked it because Thomas the Tank Engine is a TV show that my kids liked to watch when they were smaller. There where of course a few of the usual Hollywood silly, brain-dead stunts like the tank scene. It could have been so cool but it was really ruined by the total lack of intelligence in the stunt following the cool revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really liked Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym as well as Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne. I was not too impressed by Paul Rudd but on the while I guess he was not too bad. It is a bit of a shame though that when Hollywood feels they need to throw in a bit of family drama they always have to throw in a divorce. It is rather depressing for us that have lived through such a tragedy after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBottom line, this was a surprisingly enjoyable movie. Far better than quite a few of the super hero movies that Marvel/Hollywood have produced like for instance the abysmal Spiderman movies although that is of course a personal opinion.\",\n          \"Sam Raimi's Spider-Man captures the spirit of the comic book hero and it's still one of my all time favourite superhero movies. It lays out the perfect blueprint for a superhero origin story that I love revisiting every year or so. I've always been able to relate to Peter Parker growing up. Tobey Maguire and Co. delivered a great interpretation of the characters in a way that still can not be matched.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2897,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/67bc856655e3994bbd46b6f9\",\n          \"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58a720ecc3a368672e00abda\",\n          \"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/616afe9207a808004482bd65\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_created_at\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2897,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2025-02-24T14:42:46.422Z\",\n          \"2017-02-17T16:12:28.821Z\",\n          \"2021-10-16T16:32:18.509Z\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"author_rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2.177910757121824,\n        \"min\": 0.5,\n        \"max\": 10.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6.0,\n          5.0,\n          3.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Moral judgements for four wealthy tech executives are only true or false, when viewed from their  perspective, which is mired in hyper capitalism. For them, morality is grounded in the ruthless pursuit of  individual wealth, allegedly to leverage technocratic human evolution (trans-humanism). \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one of them challenges this world view, during a rich pals getaway, things turn darkly comical.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see the rather understated critique of the modern obsession with an on line life this film presents. A place where truth is allegedly manufactured, not told.\\r\\nThe gleeful, almost childlike immaturity, wilful recklessness and narcissism, of those who have built it. Also on a certain level, the tech elites uselessness. One can't even boil an egg. So much for the value of social media, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell yes and frankly, \"no\". This film overplays its hand. It tries to promote the mainstream media as a source of truth, when in fact, people have turned to social media precisely \"because\" of mainstream journalism's unwillingness, to tell truth to power. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of its flaws, social media has given genuine investigative journalists and courageous whistle blowers, a platform to expose the malfeasance of corrupted power. Something this film, rather too conveniently, overlooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, this is not a bad film. As a mild, dark comedy, it very reasonably makes wholly valid points about social media and by extension, big tech's, shortcomings. Where it falls short, its its inability to tell the other side of the story. In vogue labels, like \"misinformation\", so popular with glib politicians and the less than transparent mainstream media, could as easily be applied to them, as they could, the high tech, on line world and those who built it.\n",

It felt derivatively unoriginal and fairly predictable, with unnatural dialogue not helping. I could ignore that if the kills were cool, but none of which really came across as all that meaningful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prom setting is an issue, it's one that feels so overdone in movies that any new release needs to do something extra unique to stand out - and I don't believe this one does anything close to that. It is at least short in run time and those onscreen don't produce anything all that bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia Fowler's Lori is admittedly the only character I found to be minimally interesting, though Fina Strazza does put in a decent performance too as Tiffany. She is overly cartooney, though the same can be said for Chris Klein and others to be honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarrin Baker's character has a dumb catchphrase, though I admit I found it to be passably amusing. I will also give credit for the ending, I didn't love it but, to be fair, I didn't predict one part of the reveal - so kudos for that. It sadly isn't enough to save what proceeds, mind you.\n",

Is it predictable? Absolutely. Formulaic? No doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it’s undeniably fun, visually engaging, and driven by a charismatic cast and a director who knows exactly what he’s doing. Guy Ritchie brings his trademark energy without betraying the genre’s core identity, and James Vanderbilt delivers a solid, compelling script.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a shame the film didn’t get the theater release it deserved – like the ancient sites it explores, it should have been experienced in all its grandeur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B\n",

I can’t really dispute that. But since I was walking in with my eyes wide open, I enjoyed it for what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere isn’t enough exploration or exposition that gives us any idea what the characters are really about and we’re left to pee together through throwaway lines and a bunch of inferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several characters that are involved that you never find out what their backstory is, why they’re doing what they’re doing, or what the end goal is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is one we’ve all heard before, and the neat little tricks and puzzles. It takes to find the end goal is clever and brings back memories of the da Vinci code and other similar stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will be one of those movies that’s on and families can enjoy for quite some time, but it won’t win any awards. Still it entertained me for the two hours it was on and at this point, that’s all I’m looking for in movies.\n",

There were aspects about it from the perspective of an origin story that were interesting but something about the pacing and acting just felt… off. I can't quite put my finger on it but the first word that comes to mind is \"campy\". Kind of like I was watching one of the last three Star Wars movies. The dialog and overall tone just weren't serious enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trailer for [X-Men: Days of Future Past](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/127585-x-men-days-of-future-past) looks better and Bryan Singer is back at the helm. The best X-Men movies are without a doubt 1 & 2 so here's hoping he can steer this back a bit.\n",
              "2893    On IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of \"normal\" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that…), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the \"old\" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy… \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything.

I felt entertained throughout with nothing bothering me whatsoever, with the score and the cast particularly standing out. I will say it starts stronger than it ends, but that's not to say it isn't all enjoyable because it certainly is.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames McAvoy is very good as Charles Xavier, while Michael Fassbender is excellent as Erik Lehnsherr. Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence and Kevin Bacon were three others who I liked watching too. Back to the score, it's tremendous - some parts reminded me of the outstanding theme of television's <em>'The Crown'</em>.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was feeling the decline across the preceding four releases, but thankfully this regains the series' footing and then some. Intrigued to see where it goes from here. Onwards to <em>'The Wolverine'</em>*! *watching in release order\\r\\n\\r\\n/copied directly from my Letterboxd review\\\n",

James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger \"Xavier\" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of \"Erik\". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of \"Shaw\" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and \"Erik\" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's \"Raven\" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky \"Hank\" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of \"Magneto\" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the \"X-Men\". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen.\n",

First Class tells the origin story of Xavier, Magneto, and the X-Men with a 1960s setting and inexperienced young heroes. These raw and unrefined portrayals of Magneto and Xavier shined the characters in a fascinating new light. The story was engaging and fresh. It felt so new and unique - unlike anything ever seen before with this franchise. All these little-known characters raised the stakes since so many weren’t a part of the original movies leaving their fates unknown and futures unsecured. The 60s style added a cool new aesthetic to the franchise and seeing the beginning of the friendship between Xavier and Magneto with moments of laughter and fun gave the franchise the reboot it needed.\n",

Moral judgements for four wealthy tech executives are only true or false, when viewed from their  perspective, which is mired in hyper capitalism. For them, morality is grounded in the ruthless pursuit of  individual wealth, allegedly to leverage technocratic human evolution (trans-humanism). \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one of them challenges this world view, during a rich pals getaway, things turn darkly comical.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see the rather understated critique of the modern obsession with an on line life this film presents. A place where truth is allegedly manufactured, not told.\\r\\nThe gleeful, almost childlike immaturity, wilful recklessness and narcissism, of those who have built it. Also on a certain level, the tech elites uselessness. One can't even boil an egg. So much for the value of social media, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell yes and frankly, \"no\". This film overplays its hand. It tries to promote the mainstream media as a source of truth, when in fact, people have turned to social media precisely \"because\" of mainstream journalism's unwillingness, to tell truth to power. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of its flaws, social media has given genuine investigative journalists and courageous whistle blowers, a platform to expose the malfeasance of corrupted power. Something this film, rather too conveniently, overlooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, this is not a bad film. As a mild, dark comedy, it very reasonably makes wholly valid points about social media and by extension, big tech's, shortcomings. Where it falls short, its its inability to tell the other side of the story. In vogue labels, like \"misinformation\", so popular with glib politicians and the less than transparent mainstream media, could as easily be applied to them, as they could, the high tech, on line world and those who built it.</td>\n",

I could ignore that if the kills were cool, but none of which really came across as all that meaningful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prom setting is an issue, it's one that feels so overdone in movies that any new release needs to do something extra unique to stand out - and I don't believe this one does anything close to that. It is at least short in run time and those onscreen don't produce anything all that bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia Fowler's Lori is admittedly the only character I found to be minimally interesting, though Fina Strazza does put in a decent performance too as Tiffany. She is overly cartooney, though the same can be said for Chris Klein and others to be honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarrin Baker's character has a dumb catchphrase, though I admit I found it to be passably amusing. I will also give credit for the ending, I didn't love it but, to be fair, I didn't predict one part of the reveal - so kudos for that. It sadly isn't enough to save what proceeds, mind you.</td>\n",

              "      <td>On IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of \"normal\" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that…), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the \"old\" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy… \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything.

James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger \"Xavier\" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of \"Erik\". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of \"Shaw\" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and \"Erik\" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's \"Raven\" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky \"Hank\" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of \"Magneto\" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the \"X-Men\". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen.</td>\n",

              "      <td>**X-Men: First Class reset the board and brought new life to a franchise that had lost its way.**\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter X-Men: The Last Stand and Wolverine Origins, it was clear the X-Men franchise had gone off the rails, but First Class saved the day! First Class tells the origin story of Xavier, Magneto, and the X-Men with a 1960s setting and inexperienced young heroes. These raw and unrefined portrayals of Magneto and Xavier shined the characters in a fascinating new light. The story was engaging and fresh. It felt so new and unique - unlike anything ever seen before with this franchise. All these little-known characters raised the stakes since so many weren’t a part of the original movies leaving their fates unknown and futures unsecured. The 60s style added a cool new aesthetic to the franchise and seeing the beginning of the friendship between Xavier and Magneto with moments of laughter and fun gave the franchise the reboot it needed.</td>\n",

Moral judgements for four wealthy tech executives are only true or false, when viewed from their  perspective, which is mired in hyper capitalism. For them, morality is grounded in the ruthless pursuit of  individual wealth, allegedly to leverage technocratic human evolution (trans-humanism). \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one of them challenges this world view, during a rich pals getaway, things turn darkly comical.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see the rather understated critique of the modern obsession with an on line life this film presents. A place where truth is allegedly manufactured, not told.\\r\\nThe gleeful, almost childlike immaturity, wilful recklessness and narcissism, of those who have built it. Also on a certain level, the tech elites uselessness. One can't even boil an egg. So much for the value of social media, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell yes and frankly, \"no\". This film overplays its hand. It tries to promote the mainstream media as a source of truth, when in fact, people have turned to social media precisely \"because\" of mainstream journalism's unwillingness, to tell truth to power. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of its flaws, social media has given genuine investigative journalists and courageous whistle blowers, a platform to expose the malfeasance of corrupted power. Something this film, rather too conveniently, overlooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, this is not a bad film. As a mild, dark comedy, it very reasonably makes wholly valid points about social media and by extension, big tech's, shortcomings. Where it falls short, its its inability to tell the other side of the story. In vogue labels, like \"misinformation\", so popular with glib politicians and the less than transparent mainstream media, could as easily be applied to them, as they could, the high tech, on line world and those who built it.   \n",

It felt derivatively unoriginal and fairly predictable, with unnatural dialogue not helping. I could ignore that if the kills were cool, but none of which really came across as all that meaningful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prom setting is an issue, it's one that feels so overdone in movies that any new release needs to do something extra unique to stand out - and I don't believe this one does anything close to that. It is at least short in run time and those onscreen don't produce anything all that bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia Fowler's Lori is admittedly the only character I found to be minimally interesting, though Fina Strazza does put in a decent performance too as Tiffany. She is overly cartooney, though the same can be said for Chris Klein and others to be honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarrin Baker's character has a dumb catchphrase, though I admit I found it to be passably amusing. I will also give credit for the ending, I didn't love it but, to be fair, I didn't predict one part of the reveal - so kudos for that. It sadly isn't enough to save what proceeds, mind you.   \n",

Is it predictable? Absolutely. Formulaic? No doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it’s undeniably fun, visually engaging, and driven by a charismatic cast and a director who knows exactly what he’s doing. Guy Ritchie brings his trademark energy without betraying the genre’s core identity, and James Vanderbilt delivers a solid, compelling script.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a shame the film didn’t get the theater release it deserved – like the ancient sites it explores, it should have been experienced in all its grandeur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B   \n",

I can’t really dispute that. But since I was walking in with my eyes wide open, I enjoyed it for what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere isn’t enough exploration or exposition that gives us any idea what the characters are really about and we’re left to pee together through throwaway lines and a bunch of inferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several characters that are involved that you never find out what their backstory is, why they’re doing what they’re doing, or what the end goal is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is one we’ve all heard before, and the neat little tricks and puzzles. It takes to find the end goal is clever and brings back memories of the da Vinci code and other similar stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will be one of those movies that’s on and families can enjoy for quite some time, but it won’t win any awards. Still it entertained me for the two hours it was on and at this point, that’s all I’m looking for in movies.   \n",

There were aspects about it from the perspective of an origin story that were interesting but something about the pacing and acting just felt… off. I can't quite put my finger on it but the first word that comes to mind is \"campy\". Kind of like I was watching one of the last three Star Wars movies. The dialog and overall tone just weren't serious enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trailer for [X-Men: Days of Future Past](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/127585-x-men-days-of-future-past) looks better and Bryan Singer is back at the helm. The best X-Men movies are without a doubt 1 & 2 so here's hoping he can steer this back a bit.   \n",
              "2893  On IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of \"normal\" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that…), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the \"old\" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy… \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything.

I felt entertained throughout with nothing bothering me whatsoever, with the score and the cast particularly standing out. I will say it starts stronger than it ends, but that's not to say it isn't all enjoyable because it certainly is.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames McAvoy is very good as Charles Xavier, while Michael Fassbender is excellent as Erik Lehnsherr. Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence and Kevin Bacon were three others who I liked watching too. Back to the score, it's tremendous - some parts reminded me of the outstanding theme of television's <em>'The Crown'</em>.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was feeling the decline across the preceding four releases, but thankfully this regains the series' footing and then some. Intrigued to see where it goes from here. Onwards to <em>'The Wolverine'</em>*! *watching in release order\\r\\n\\r\\n/copied directly from my Letterboxd review\\   \n",

James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger \"Xavier\" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of \"Erik\". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of \"Shaw\" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and \"Erik\" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's \"Raven\" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky \"Hank\" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of \"Magneto\" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the \"X-Men\". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen.   \n",

First Class tells the origin story of Xavier, Magneto, and the X-Men with a 1960s setting and inexperienced young heroes. These raw and unrefined portrayals of Magneto and Xavier shined the characters in a fascinating new light. The story was engaging and fresh. It felt so new and unique - unlike anything ever seen before with this franchise. All these little-known characters raised the stakes since so many weren’t a part of the original movies leaving their fates unknown and futures unsecured. The 60s style added a cool new aesthetic to the franchise and seeing the beginning of the friendship between Xavier and Magneto with moments of laughter and fun gave the franchise the reboot it needed.   \n",

For them, morality is grounded in the ruthless pursuit of  individual wealth, allegedly to leverage technocratic human evolution (trans-humanism). \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one of them challenges this world view, during a rich pals getaway, things turn darkly comical.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see the rather understated critique of the modern obsession with an on line life this film presents. A place where truth is allegedly manufactured, not told.\\r\\nThe gleeful, almost childlike immaturity, wilful recklessness and narcissism, of those who have built it. Also on a certain level, the tech elites uselessness. One can't even boil an egg. So much for the value of social media, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell yes and frankly, \"no\". This film overplays its hand. It tries to promote the mainstream media as a source of truth, when in fact, people have turned to social media precisely \"because\" of mainstream journalism's unwillingness, to tell truth to power. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of its flaws, social media has given genuine investigative journalists and courageous whistle blowers, a platform to expose the malfeasance of corrupted power. Something this film, rather too conveniently, overlooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, this is not a bad film. As a mild, dark comedy, it very reasonably makes wholly valid points about social media and by extension, big tech's, shortcomings. Where it falls short, its its inability to tell the other side of the story. In vogue labels, like \"misinformation\", so popular with glib politicians and the less than transparent mainstream media, could as easily be applied to them, as they could, the high tech, on line world and those who built it.</td>\n",

Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of \"normal\" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that…), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the \"old\" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy… \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything.

James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger \"Xavier\" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of \"Erik\". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of \"Shaw\" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and \"Erik\" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's \"Raven\" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky \"Hank\" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of \"Magneto\" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the \"X-Men\". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen.</td>\n",

First Class tells the origin story of Xavier, Magneto, and the X-Men with a 1960s setting and inexperienced young heroes. These raw and unrefined portrayals of Magneto and Xavier shined the characters in a fascinating new light. The story was engaging and fresh. It felt so new and unique - unlike anything ever seen before with this franchise. All these little-known characters raised the stakes since so many weren’t a part of the original movies leaving their fates unknown and futures unsecured. The 60s style added a cool new aesthetic to the franchise and seeing the beginning of the friendship between Xavier and Magneto with moments of laughter and fun gave the franchise the reboot it needed.</td>\n",

It was totally new and held plenty of action so it was worth watching once. Twice? Probably not. The second was much the same as the first and by the fourth you are as bored as it can get. Not sure what's wrong with Keanu, but having fun making a movie and actually making something worth watching are two very different things.\\r\\nThe guy should keep his james bond ninja training fantasies to himself and maybe think about producing and acting in something that doesn't make him look like a child. This movie was pure garbage. What a waste of time and money. Let's just hope he didn't get the shot.\",\n          \"I have to say that I did not have great hopes for this movie. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. As can be expected from a Marvel super hero movie it is not the most intelligent plot around but instead rather heavy on special effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving said that the plot is not bad given the context. I have never read any of the Ant-Man comics so I had no idea what to expect. The little expectation I had was of some guy turning into some ant like creature smashing things left right and center. So it was somewhat of a surprise to me when I found out that the guy was actually shrinking himself to ant size. Actually I went a bit \\u201cwhat the f\\u2026\\u201d when I first realized this and felt that this was going to be boring.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in the end, I felt it worked out quite well. If it would have just been about some guy shrinking himself then it would indeed have been somewhat boring but the added coolness of this guy being able to command armies of bad-ass ants really helped stave of the boredom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I wrote above it is a Marvel super hero movie so it is heavy on special effects and, personally, I felt they where quite okay. There is of course quite a bit of action in the movie as well as a bit of humour. I quite liked the parts where the Ant-Man and his nemesis slugged it out in a children\\u2019s room and a giant size Thomas the Tank Engine was thrown through the roof and into the garden. Maybe I liked it because Thomas the Tank Engine is a TV show that my kids liked to watch when they were smaller. There where of course a few of the usual Hollywood silly, brain-dead stunts like the tank scene. It could have been so cool but it was really ruined by the total lack of intelligence in the stunt following the cool revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really liked Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym as well as Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne. I was not too impressed by Paul Rudd but on the while I guess he was not too bad. It is a bit of a shame though that when Hollywood feels they need to throw in a bit of family drama they always have to throw in a divorce. It is rather depressing for us that have lived through such a tragedy after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBottom line, this was a surprisingly enjoyable movie. Far better than quite a few of the super hero movies that Marvel/Hollywood have produced like for instance the abysmal Spiderman movies although that is of course a personal opinion.\",\n          \"Sam Raimi's Spider-Man captures the spirit of the comic book hero and it's still one of my all time favourite superhero movies. It lays out the perfect blueprint for a superhero origin story that I love revisiting every year or so. I've always been able to relate to Peter Parker growing up. Tobey Maguire and Co. delivered a great interpretation of the characters in a way that still can not be matched.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertweet_sentiment_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"NEU\",\n          \"NEG\",\n          \"POS\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertweet_sentiment_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.16054418598709969,\n        \"min\": 0.37242671847343445,\n        \"max\": 0.9931718111038208,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2862,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.7973461151123047,\n          0.953059196472168,\n          0.7875801920890808\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
